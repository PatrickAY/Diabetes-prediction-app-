# Diabetes-prediction-app-
A machine learning web app that predicts diabetes based on health metrics like glucose, BMI, insulin, and more. Built with Random Forest and Gradio, it displays prediction confidence with visuals and offers risk categories and tips. Developed for a scholarship competition.

#  Diabetes Prediction App (ML + Gradio)

A machine learning web application that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on key health indicators. It also displays the prediction confidence using a bar chart and provides health risk categories with tips. Built by Patrick Ayisi and team as a scholarship competition capstone.
